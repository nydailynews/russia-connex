    <h1>Here’s what we know about Donald Trump’s ties to Russia</h1>

    <p class="dropcap">You hear about the investigation into President Trump and Russia every day. It is extremely complicated, and difficult to keep track of everything.</p>

    <p>There is the criminal investigation being led Special Counsel Robert Mueller on behalf of the Justice Department and the FBI. It could potentially end in criminal charges for people in Trump’s White House and inner circle. Then there are two House investigations -- one from its Intelligence Committee and one from its Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Finally, there are two Senate investigations -- one from its Intelligence Committee and one from its Judiciary Committee.</p>

    <p>All of these investigations are centered on the same central topics: What role Russian hackers played in the 2016 campaign, and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. Most of these investigations also have the same players overlapping, as well as some side characters whose ultimate significance may not yet be fully understood.</p>

    <p>Here’s a look at who’s who at a glance, and how they’re connected.</p>

            <h2>Donald Trump</h2>
            <h3>Became the 45th president in a surprise 2016 victory</h3>
            <div id="read-more" class="collapsed" onclick="clicker();">
                <p>Evidence is consistently surfacing that Trump or people in his orbit may have had some kind of interaction with the Russian government during the campaign, but Trump has denied having any political or business ties. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee testimony of former FBI Director James Comey, Trump asked Comey to back off of the criminal investigation into campaign adviser turned National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s ties to Russia. He also reportedly ordered Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and NSA Chief Mike Rogers to publicly say there was no wrongdoing on Trump’s behalf, and told them to get Comey to lay off of Flynn.</p>

        <h2>Jared Kushner</h2>
        <h3>Trump’s son-in-law, who serves as one of his closest advisers</h3>
        <div id="read-more" class="collapsed" onclick="clicker();">
            <p>Kushner had denied having any interactions with Russian officials during the campaign, but subsequently acknowledged having two meetings. Reuters reported in May that Kushner allegedly spoke with Kremlin officials last year about setting up a secret backchannel to communicate about diplomatic matters. Around the same time, Kushner also met with the chief executive of a state-owned bank who has ties to Putin, and it is not clear why. Kushner has reportedly become a focus of the criminal investigation, but he faces no charges or specific allegations.</p>
